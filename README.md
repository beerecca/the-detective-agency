# the-detective-agency

This project was generated with express-generator and create-react-app, and is deployed to heroku. It's a little full stack app that I'm using to demo some techniques in conference talks.

The `master` branch is very simple and used for "Essential JavaScript debugging tools for the modern detective".

The `structure` branch has a little more complexity in the frontend and is used for "Structuring your application story with sagas and selectors".

## Run
```
yarn
yarn start
```
The app will run at [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/)
